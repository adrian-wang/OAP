/**
 * A Parquet [[ReadSupport]] implementation for reading Parquet records as Catalyst
 * [[UnsafeRow]]s.
 *
 * The API interface of [[ReadSupport]] is a little bit over complicated because of
 * historical reasons.  In older versions of parquet-mr (say 1.6.0rc3 and prior),
 * [[ReadSupport]] need to be instantiated and initialized twice on both driver side
 * and executor side.  The [[init()]] method is for driver side initialization,
 * while [[prepareForRead()]] is for executor side.  However, starting from
 * parquet-mr 1.6.0, it's no longer the case, and [[ReadSupport]] is only
 * instantiated and initialized on executor side.
 * So, theoretically, now it's totally fine to combine these two methods
 * into a single initialization method.
 * The only reason (I could think of) to still have them here
 * is for parquet-mr API backwards-compatibility.
 *
 * Due to this reason, we no longer rely on [[ReadContext]]
 * to pass requested schema from [[init()]]
 * to [[prepareForRead()]], but use a private `var` for simplicity.
